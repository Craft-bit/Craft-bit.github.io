						<h2>What is Delve?</h2>
						<span class="image"><img src="gifs/Gameplay.gif" alt=""/></span>
						<p>As said before, Delve is a game jam project done in the fall semester.
						The team took inspiration from Celeste's art and gameplay when developing the game.
						It is a 2D platformer that takes inspiration from Celeste and cat mario to fit the deception theme.
						The story of Delve is that you are an explorer who fell into a cave and are attempting to get out.</p>

						<h2>Brainstorming</h2>
						<p>The theme of the game jam was deception, so before development we discussed how we could fit the theme into the game.
						Eventually, we decided on a cat mario inspired game where the player would get faked out by certain gameplay elements; some obstacles would be fake, falling platforms might rise instead, etc.
						Being inspired from Celeste, we stuck with a 2D art style and cave like color palette for the game.
						We chose to work with a github repository for sharing the project and a trello page to keep track of what is currently being worked on in the project.</p>

						<h2>What was My Role?</h2>
						<span class="image"><img src="gifs/Title.gif" alt=""/></span>
						<span class="image"><img src="gifs/Pause.gif" alt=""/></span>
						<p>My role was developing the UI for the game, as well as audio design.
						I implemented features such as a functional pause menu and title screen, all using Godot's built in signal features.
						The audio was used from a website called "Kenney Game Assets," but the music was constructed by me.
						I also implemented input and event support for keyboard, mouse, and gamepad in the project settings.</p>

						<h2>Challenges Faced / Changes Made</h2>
						<p>The biggest problem I faced when programming the project was getting the pause pop-up to work correctly; the game would pause, but the pop-up would not load.
						The main issue was because the canvas-layer node was placed after the control node that changed the game from being paused to not paused; so I needed to a have the canvas-layer node set as the parent, and the control node as its child.</p>
